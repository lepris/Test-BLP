# R' BOT Work dispatch App

The purpose of this app was to prove how precisely I am able to follow guidlines presented in a form of ready UX Design for a **React App**  in **Sketch**. I had one week to complete the task and complete freedom of choice in terms of technology.


# Behind the scenes
## Storybook
For this project I have chosen to learn and try a new toy **Storybook**. It was love from first sight, enabling to design and test all component's states in isolation. Although it took a while to setup and get used to, it was well worth the effort.

### Biggest benefits: 
1. Ability to set and test all different sets of props
2. Immediate access to deeply nested components
3. Quick deployment
