# R' BOT Work dispatch App

The purpose of this app was to prove how precisely I am able to follow guidelines presented in a form of ready UX Design for a **React App**  in **Sketch**. I had one week to complete the task and complete freedom of choice in terms of technology.


# Behind the scenes
## Storybook
For this project, I have chosen to learn and try a new toy **Storybook**. It was love from the first sight, enabling to design and test all component's states in isolation. Although it took a while to set up and get used to, it was well worth the effort.

### Biggest benefits: 
1. Ability to set and test all different sets of props
2. Immediate access to deeply nested components
3. Quick deployment

#### Dev Dependencies:  
- storybook/react 
- storybook-deployer
- addon-info

## SCSS
Second tech choice I decided to adopt was **SCSS** , which allowed me to define style variables, which could be used around the project: 

- Consistent colour guide for text and, borders and backgrounds
- Animated opacity transition
- Reusable shadows  

## SVG
Another great feature was importing **SVG** elements directly from **SKETCH** and using **SVGR** for generating **React** components. This solution gave me the possibility to achieve pixel-perfect icons and matching colours. 

# SUMMARY
Having tried all these nice tools in action, I am 100% convinced to follow the Storybook Driven Development path. Regretfully time constraints didn't allow to learn to test with this great platform, but I am sure it is well worth giving a go.  Developing UX Design was never so much fun before.
